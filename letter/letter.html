        Hello my cutie!! Isn't this so cool that is the magic of computer coding...
        I cannot give you smiley faces or hearts without paying money so I hope this is okay!
        I love you so much my baby this font I realize is a little hard to read so I will stick to using it here.
        Anyways baby I love you so so much here is my append to the paper letter hehe. Ugh I can't get over how cool this is
        There is a very large concern that the entire website is gonna look strange on your computer. But it shows up fine whenever
        I test it so you should theoretically be good... Okay a lot of that was filler I am realzing I will just have to make this
        letter one really long sheet... anways I love you so much. I cannot in a million years ever express to you ... You mean so 
        much to me you are just so kind and so patient and have given me second and third and fourth and fifth chances over and 
        over and over again! You have so much faith in me it's insane and I love you so much. We just make each other so much better 
        as people and I think that is so so incredibly nice. I have loved you albeit not romantically from the day we met. I used to 
        be a little bit scared of you if I'm being honest... I just didnt know you that well but had had so much lore. To be honest
        I didnt like you all that much freshman and sophomore years just because everyone I knew did not have a very high opinion of you.
        I can't judge that to be honest I didn't know you... I wonder what you and Ayden thought of me when you guys called me to
        ask about doing the homecoming week shirts. I was kinda trying to impress you at that point at least and it really has never
        changed since then. I do not show it much but I am very desperate for your approval and your love. I can't believe we have made it all
        the way to one year. We are coming up though on a year and like eight or nine months of knowing each other. I say that I started
        liking you on February seventeenth or March sixth but the truth is there was never a "day" if that makes sense. Those were just huge
        paradigm shifts if that makes sense. On the seventeenth I realized that you really were my best friend and it made me so happy when you
        sent me a gift even when Abby didnt. That was one of the last arguments we ever had... Abby was jealous because she didnt get me 
        a gift and blamed me because I told her I didnt want one. Thats true I didnt and I told you the same remember. That is the difference.
        Even when I don't want help you call bullshit and give me help anyways and I always realize you are right and I needed it. On the sixth or more 
        specifically the fifth you called me and said "I don't know what you want me to do". Maybe it was then I realized we had a connection
        much deeper than friends could ever have. Over the next two months things slowly developed and we got closer and closer and
        I realized that maybe I felt slightly warmer towards you than anyone else ever... that maybe I tried to subtly make our arms touch in class
        slightly more than I ever did with anyone else ever... that maybe I tried to spend more time with you outside of class than everyone else ...
        ... that maybe I enjoyed the touch of you skin more than I liked to admit ... that maybe I liked your laugh and your smile
        and your sleeping face on facetime more than a friend probably would... that maybe I was in love with you ... and my sweet most 
        beloved baby darling it is a feeling that has not ebbed since. Happy One Year!
