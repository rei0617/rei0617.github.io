    A very nice photo of us just before I left for Africa! <br>
    We had no idea what we would be like a month later <br>
    I liked you after my 18th birthday but I loved you after this trip <br>
    It was probably the first time in a solid <b>9</b> months that we had gone a day without talking <br>
    Don't get me wrong Africa was so cool but wow did I just miss you so crazy much <br>
    I spent every day daydreaming about you and every night nightdreaming about you <br>
    That is a tradition I have kept to this day!! <br>
    Thank you for staying with me through everything my love, you are all I have ever wanted <br>
