    Hi! Okay so now I can come clean <br>
    This whole website is a very large puzzle <br>
    I had to take some ... creative liberties ... with the numbers for this passcode haha <br>
    It's like my silly brain sink I have spent so many hours on this <br>
    Don't feel bad though my dear it is a labor or love <br>
    This is like my origami <br>
    I hope you will enjoy this I was/am so snervy about the puzzles <br>
    <br>
    Um okay what to say I am leaving this open if I need to add in anything later <br>

    <br>
