    One of the first photos of us really as a couple! <br>
    <b>15</b> days after our amazing night!! <br>
    I was the least sure of you here but even then I knew we would date for a long time <br>
    I love you so very much and I have loved you for a long time <br>
    My smile is different around you in such a special way <br>
    I have begun to smile a lot more this year <br>
    Please know it is because of you <br>
