    Our first meeting back home together! Look at us! <br>
    College is so tough but we are tougher <br>
    Just two <b>18</b> year olds against the world <br>
    We are so strong and we are made for each other <br>
    And no matter what day in and day out if we wake up <br>
    And still have the same love and drive for each other <br>
    It will all work out <br>
    And my darling the love I have for you grows more and more every day <br>
