    Our New Years photo :) look at us! <br>
    We've gotten so old since our first photos together in Perret's <br>
    I loved New Years so much <br>
    There will never be a better feeling than to be intimate <br>
    And then to fall asleep in each other's arms <br>
    Remember how you were almost late for work at <b>10</b>... oops hehe <br>
    Maybe we will make each other late for work <br>
    By not letting the other out of bed &hearts;
