    Christmas and <b>08</b> Months Anniversary Date! I hope you liked it! <br>
    I am not a very good gift giver but sometimes I am struck with a good idea <br>
    We will see how well this one goes :)! I love how much I know about you! <br>
    And how much you know about me!!! To know someone like that is so intimate <br>
    That is so nice to me that we are enveloped in each other <br>
    You have my life and schedule you know all of my friends and clubs <br>
    And I know all about yours! I think we do a very good job of staying connected! <br>
