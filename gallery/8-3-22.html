    Our lakeside date!! You loved it!!
    There is a small skip in nice photos where we had to regroup and recovene <br>
    But this is us back on top full steam ahead <b>5</b> weeks later! <br>
    Look at our smiles and our laughter and think abut how much we have grown since then!! <br>
    A year is such a long time we have worked so hard to get here &hearts; <br>
    I cannot wait to grow old with you my Mei. My gorgeous summer girl. <br>
