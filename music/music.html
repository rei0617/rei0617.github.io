    <h2>
        Hi baby! <br> </h2>
    <h3>
        This is an ever expanding website ...
        I will keep adding to this list!! <br>
        My priority was real quality songs 
        ...and I am not as much of a music person as you 
    </h3>
    <div id="songs">
        <b> Waltz No. 2 </b> <br>
        Okay this was the one I knew I had to start this out with.. It's slow it's romantic it's nice and had remineded 
        me of you since long before we ever started dating ... it's very elegant!! Just like you!!
        Notice how it starts of so slow but then has such a nice swell. I am a big fan of the waltz time and I associate
        it a little bit with late nights on the couch with you <br>
        <b> My Way of Life </b> <br>
        Haha okay this one is easy my love this is such a me song and you know it but it is one I have made you listen to 
        it so many times just because of how strongly I associate it with you. It's true it really is!
        You're my Way of Life!! That's such a nice way to put it like it really is and I just love the song and love you baby!
        This song wants to make me remind you that you are loved beyond your wildest dreams! <br>
        <b> Paint a Lady </b> <br>
        Haha this is a test this where it starts to get into your style... Do you know the artist..? Im just curious hehe DO YOU! 
        Well if you didnt its the same girl who wrote Rainy Days from Everything Everywhere All at Once... that is a good song too but
        not as happy of a cute love song as I want on here. This one is just so nice maybe I misunderstand the lyrics but to me it reminds me
        of you and of you giving me a purpose and feeling in life... my dream girl... I listen to this song a lot and think of you. <br>
        <b> My Funny Valentine </b> <br>
        Haha this is a very slow song I have sung it to you in the car before ... it is another one I adore so much because of how
        strongly I associate it with you!! It's just so slow so nice... dooooont change a hair for meeee not if you caaare for meeee 
        because youre my faaaaavorite work of aaaaaarrrt! &hearts; <br>
        <b> I'd Like to Walk Around in Your Mind </b> <br>
        This is music that I also just associate so strongly with you it is all old slow songs maybe that is a trend my baby!
        We have a very slow very gentle very old kind of love. You're my childhood best friend who I was always going to marry!
        My high school sweetheart and one day we will be so old together in each other's arms. I'm so incredibly in love with you.
        You are everything I have ever loved. <br>
        <b> Anywhere you are </b> <br>
        Okay this is another nice one... Confessiom I have started listening to Susan Christie a lot since we started dating hehe...
        I love this song also it just exudes love and sweetness some of her songs are sad but some are just so nice and sweet. This 
        one's lyrics are much more self explanatory than paint a lady hehe imagine I am singing these all to you my beloved :)<br>
